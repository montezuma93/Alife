ALife
=======================

This is my master thesis project.
The original code was done and taken from https://github.com/jmread/alife.

The goal of this project is to extend the given world of bugs and create and compare different cognitive models and reeinfocrement models for the living bugs.

The extensions of the world are:
	- Add the possibily to create the world randomized.
	- Add multiple kind of plants (healthy, hard-and soft-toxic as well as herbal)
	- Add another kind of animal/monster (a spider) (Which is dangerous for bugs)
	- Add tree trunks, which can be used by animals in order to create bridges to move to other islands or through lakes)
	--> A random string should be created and adjust the world by setting a lot of different paramters in order to compare
		the behaviour of the bugs in different environments
		
	--> Adding one or more communicating system between the bugs, by using a communication system that can be explained with 		cognitive models
		
The other part of this project is finding and implementing different kind of cognitive models and reinforcment models for the bugs to live and survive in the random generated world.
